//Enter stuff into here. To add in values, use this syntax: (x,y) Put each value on it's own line.

//This is how many digits each x or y value will have.
//For example, if you have an x value that is 1000, then you would put 4 here.
//Note that you need to make every value this many digits.
//So if you have (1000, 90) and (10, 0.9), you would put 4 here and change the values to (1000, 0090) and (0010, 0000.9).
