MATH STUFF FOR PROGRAMMING PRACTICE!

More info is availiable at the wiki.

I need people to accually test out this program!

I also would love suggestions for features, go post it in issues with the enhancement tag.

Would anybody like to help with coding? I would like some help with trying to get EzrebMath to be able to use
custom plugins, could anybody help with that?
